        <h2>Welcome to Our Photo Gallery</h2>
        <p>
            Our gallery showcases a collection of special moments that reflect the vibrant life at <b>IES Campus</b>. 
            Every picture tells a story — from classroom learning to exciting outdoor activities, from science fairs to art exhibitions. 
            We believe that education is not confined to textbooks, but extends to real-world experiences and creative expressions.
        </p>

        <p>
            These photographs are a testament to the passion, hard work, and joy our students bring to every project, 
            workshop, and event. We encourage creativity, teamwork, and leadership in everything we do.

        <p>
            Learning goes beyond the classroom! Our students regularly participate in educational trips and professional workshops
